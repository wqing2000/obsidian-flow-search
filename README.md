# Flow Search

Flow Search provides a smooth, Alfred-like search experience with a single, search box.

## Features

- Quick Search Note (Implemented)

  Press the activation shortcut and type a space to instantly trigger Obsidian’s native quick switcher (Quick Switcher: Open Quick Switcher).
- Command Scope Configuration (Implemented)

  Configure which commands (including those provided by other plugins) should appear in Flow Search. Commands that are disabled will not be displayed.

- Command Intelligent Sorting & Pinning (Planned)

  Frequently used commands are automatically prioritized. You can also pin commands for instant access. **This feature will try to stay consistent with Obsidian’s built-in command palette by reading the core plugin’s pinned and recentCommands settings.**

- Bookmarks Search (Planned)

  Type bm to display a read-only list of your bookmarks.
